NAME
    ThreatNet::Bot::AmmoBot - Tail threat messages from a file to ThreatNet

SYNOPIS
      # Tail ThreatNet-compatible messages from a file to IRC
      > ./ammobot --nick=ammobot            \
      >           --server=irc.freenode.org \
      >           --channel=#threatnet      \
      >           --port=6669               \
      >           --file=/var/log/threats.log

DESCRIPTION
    "ammobot" is the basic foot soldier of the ThreatNet bot ecosystem,
    fetching ammunition and bringing it to the channel.

    It connects to a single ThreatNet channel, and then tails a file
    scanning for threat messages while following the basic channel rules.

    When it sees a ThreatNet::Message::IPv4-compatible message appear at the
    end of the file, it will report it to the channel (subject to the
    appropriate channel rules).

    Its main purpose is to make it as easy as possible to connect any system
    capable of writing a log file to ThreatNet. If an application can be
    configured or coded to spit out the appropriately formatted messages to
    a file, then "ammobot" will patiently watch for them and then haul them
    off to the channel for you (so you don't have to).

METHODS
  spawn %args
    The isn't really any big reason that you would be wanting to instantiate
    a "ThreatNet::Bot::AmmoBot" yourself, but if it comes to that you do it
    by simply passing a list of the appropriate arguments to the "spawn"
    method.

    Because "ammobot" is POE based, "spawn" behaves like your typical POE
    component.

      # Create the ammobot
      my $Bot = ThreatNet::Bot::AmmoBot->spawn( %args );
  
      # Run the ammobot
      POE::Kernel->run;
